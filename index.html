			<h1> About Me </h1>	
			<div class="photo-wrapper">
				<img alt="portrait of the artist as a young dev" src="assets/mahfayce.png">
			</div>

			<div class="bio"> 
				<p> In a nutshell, I like to make things, and I ask a lot of questions. I graduated early from Columbia University with a B.A. in Chinese Literature and a few computer science-related (including computer music-related) courses under my belt. After graduation, I lived in China for a while, teaching and working at an educational startup. 
				</p>

				<p> While in China I self-taught a lot of web development basics, and returned to New York to improve my skills with a bunch of similarly motivated and creative young people at the <a class="colored-link" href="http://appacademy.io">App Academy</a>.
				</p>

				<p> Outside of developing, I've been a professional musician (insofar as I've been paid to perform, and have gigged around New York City), and strive daily to better express myself on the piano, guitar, and my own homemade software instruments. I'm always learning, and I laugh a lot. No need to be over serious about the little things.
